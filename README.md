# Levex

Levex is a permissionless lending margin trading protocol that enables traders or other applications to long or short on any trading pair on DEXs efficiently and securely. 
Key features:
- Margin Trading with Liquidity on DEXs, connecting traders to trade with the most liquid decentralized markets like Uniswap, PancakeSwap, SushiSwap, and more.
- Risk Isolation Lending Pools, having two separated pools for each pair, and different risk and interest rate parameters, allow lenders to invest according to the risk-reward ratio.
- Risk Calculation with Real-time AMM Price, calculating collateral ratio with real-time AMM price for any pair available from a DEX.
- OnDemand Oracle uses TWAP prices provided by the DEX to detect price manipulation and force price updates to make it valid for trading and liquidation.
- LToken is an interest rate-bearing token for each lending pool, allowing the third-party to incentivize their community to provide liquidity into the lending pools into support margin trading for their token pairs.
- LVX Token is the protocol native token, minted by protocol usage, and staked to get rewards and protocol privileges.
- Very intuitive and user-friendly UI design.
